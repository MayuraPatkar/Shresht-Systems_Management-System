# Dashboard Implementation Status

## âœ… Completed

### Frontend (dashboard.html & dashboard.js)
- **Date/Time Display**: Real-time clock with formatted date
- **Statistics Cards**: 6 cards showing key metrics
  - Total Quotations
  - Total Projects  
  - Total Earned
  - Total Unpaid
  - Total Expenditure
  - Remaining Services
- **Recent Activity**: Last 10 activities from quotations, invoices, waybills, and services
- **Stock Alerts**: Items below minimum quantity threshold
- **Pending Tasks**: Summary of unpaid invoices, pending services, and low stock items
- **Performance Metrics**: Month-over-month comparison cards for revenue, projects, quotations

### Backend API Endpoints

#### Analytics Routes (`routes/analytics.js`)
- `GET /analytics/overview` - Returns aggregated statistics for all dashboard cards
- `GET /analytics/comparison` - Returns month-over-month performance data

#### Module Routes (All with `/all` endpoint)
- `GET /quotation/all` - Returns all quotations sorted by creation date (newest first)
- `GET /invoice/all` - Returns all invoices sorted by creation date (newest first)
- `GET /waybill/all` - Returns all waybills sorted by creation date (newest first)
- `GET /service/all` - Returns all services (invoices with service_month > 0) sorted by creation date
- `GET /stock/all` - Returns all stock items sorted alphabetically by item name

## Features

### Number Formatting
- **Indian Number System**: Uses `formatIndian()` utility function
  - Example: 1,00,00,000 (1 crore), 10,00,000 (10 lakhs)
  - Supports decimal places (default 0, can specify)

### Animations
- **Counter Animation**: Smooth count-up animations for all statistics
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders while data is being fetched
- **Empty States**: Friendly messages when no data is available

### Data Aggregation
- **Recent Activity**: Combines and sorts recent items from 4 different modules
- **Pending Tasks**: Intelligently counts:
  - Unpaid invoices (payment_received: false)
  - Pending services (current date >= due date based on service_month)
  - Low stock items (quantity <= min_quantity)

### Performance Metrics
- **Month-over-Month Comparison**: Shows percentage change for:
  - Total Revenue (earned + unpaid from invoices)
  - Total Projects (count from invoices)
  - Total Quotations (count from quotations)
- **Visual Indicators**: Green for increase, red for decrease

## API Response Formats

### `/analytics/overview`
```json
{
  "totalProjects": 45,
  "totalQuotations": 23,
  "totalEarned": 1250000,
  "totalUnpaid": 350000,
  "totalExpenditure": 450000,
  "remainingServices": 12
}
```

### `/analytics/comparison`
```json
{
  "currentMonth": {
    "revenue": 500000,
    "projects": 15,
    "quotations": 8
  },
  "previousMonth": {
    "revenue": 450000,
    "projects": 12,
    "quotations": 7
  },
  "percentageChange": {
    "revenue": 11.11,
    "projects": 25.00,
    "quotations": 14.29
  }
}
```

### Module `/all` endpoints
All return arrays of documents from their respective collections, sorted by `createdAt: -1` (newest first).

## How to Test

1. **Start the server**: `npm run server` or `npm start`
2. **Navigate to dashboard**: Open `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/dashboard.html`
3. **Check browser console**: Look for any fetch errors
4. **Verify data loading**:
   - All 6 stat cards should populate with numbers
   - Recent Activity should show latest items
   - Stock Alerts should show low stock items
   - Pending Tasks should show correct counts
   - Performance Metrics should show percentage changes

## Notes

- All backend routes include proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Frontend gracefully handles API failures with `.catch(() => [])` fallbacks
- Empty states display helpful messages when no data is available
- All numbers use Indian number formatting for better readability
- Dashboard is fully responsive with Tailwind CSS
